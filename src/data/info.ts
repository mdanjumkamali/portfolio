  about: `
I'm a Full Stack based in India.
   I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.
I have experience in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Typescript, tailwind CSS, React JS, and Next JS. Hence,
   I have successfully completed several web projects from scratch. 
   Yet, I learn continuously and never stop exploring new technologies.
   So, I have also gained knowledge of Node JS, Express JS, Mongo DB, and Python with time.
